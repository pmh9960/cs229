\begin{answer}
Dataset 1 doesn't look like gaussian distribution. In my opinion, This is because $x2$ feature. I try to do log(x2) rather than original x2. This is the result.

Train (left), valid (right)

As you can see, for now the distributions look like gaussian distribution and the boundary is better than original one.
